 /*
    We’re working with a server that has 27 databases. 
We have a dbo.Products table in a Widgets database with columns ProductId, ProductName, Description, Price, and Created, which is a datetime field.

Bonus: We have a new marketing director who wants to rename products in our “sweet-spot” pricing to be even more unique. 
They are focused only on newer products, so filter products newer than our sales quarter ending 9/1/2022. 
Write a query to return products that are priced from $8 to $27 whose product names end with the letters "er". i.e. “Cheese Hammer”. 
Sort it by highest price, first, and then product name in alphabetical order. Exclude NULL descriptions and any products that were created before the sales quarter cutoff.
